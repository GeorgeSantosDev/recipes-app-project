<h1>Recipes App</h1>

<p>
    Recipes App is an application to see, search, filter, favorite and track the progress of food and drink recipes. The project was developed
    in group using context API, React Hooks and RTL. During development the group used tools such as kanban, slack and scrum methodologies for agile 
    development. The code developed by all group is available on this branch: https://github.com/GeorgeSantosDev/recipes-app-project/tree/group-code. 
</p>

<p>
    I refactored the application making the code cleaner and more readable and better reusing the structure of the react components. As the structure of 
    the application has changed, it will still be necessary to rewrite the tests to ajust the logic modification to coverage all application.  The files 
    of test Login.test.js and Profile.test.js available on the branch group-code was written by me.
</p>

<p>
    In this project I was able to develop skills such as communication, collaboration, active listening, team work and leadership. 
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of the project is to be a mobile application, so the stylization was developed to screens of max width 420px.   
</p>
    
<p>
   The application was deployed with Vercel.
